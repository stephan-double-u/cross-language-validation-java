# Cross Language Validation Java 

This library implements the server side part of the [Cross Language Validation Schema](https://github.com/stephan-double-u/cross-language-validation-schema),
i.e. it contains:
- an rich API to define the different kinds of validation rules that are specified by that schema
- a validator that checks the validation rules against the relevant objects
- a serializer that produces a JSON representation of the defined validation rules according to that schema

## TODOs
- Document
- Write more tests
- Release
